	<p>THDC is the national agricultural resource center with development in it's mandate. Many farmers today grow fruits and vegetables using quality seeds and technology dissiminated by the center.</p>
    <p>Improving smallholder fuit and vegetable production and marketing skills can directly benefit women. Women often are responsible for producing and selling fruits and vegetables. Women grow vegetables and fruits in home gardens for family use and for market sale, providing an important source of nutrition and income; they often provide the only cash resource for women to use for the welfare of their families. Women are often preferentially employed as laborers in vegetable and fruit production, and have a major role in value-addition after harvest.</p>

    <p>THDC conducts demonstration trials, builds networks, and carries out training and promotion activities to raise awareness of the role of fruits and vegetables for improved health.</p>
	<p>Fruits and vegetables can alleviate poverty by creating new jobs and new sources of income for farmers and landless laborers, improve health by providing essential micronutrients lacking in diets, enhance learning and working capacities of adults and children through improved diets and health, and improve the sustainability of food production practices by diversifying cropping systems. The Center's development work focuses on producing improved fruits lines, and promoting safe production practices.</p>

    <p>We promote open source and open data thoughout THDC, engaging and informing citizens.</p>
	<p>We built thdcmustang.gov.np on the open source. Because it's open source, we can continue to take advantage of improvement to the operability and security. As we observe its use , we will continue to add new capabilities. Therefore, we do not say it is "complete" and we probably never will.</p>
